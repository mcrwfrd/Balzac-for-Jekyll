The other day I found myself, for what feels like the millionth time, walking through face-blistering winds on my way to school. Its not a far walk, but doing this every day in -15 degrees C temperatures and winds at X km/h really tests my mental strength. I've built a pretty good tolerance after living in Canada for all of my twenty-year-long life so far, but the other day I was brought to my limit. It's just about March, we've had a couple of tantilizingly warm days in Fabruary so far, and the fact that it still gets this cold seems unfair. I almost became extremely frustrated by allowing my meditation/focus to slip and let the negative thoughts flow. But then I saw something which made me catch myself just before allowing this to happen. I saw a cyclist riding down the street in this god-awful weather during rush hour, and he was *singing*.
