Claire and I finally got around to getting our lead accreditations at the nearest climbing gym with walls high enough to require ropes.

###Breathe 
If, after Claire lowered from the top of my first lead climb in over a year, someone had asked me what was going through my mind during the climb, I wouldn't have had the foggiest idea of what to tell them. The truth is that I have no idea what goes through my mind while I'm leading a route. My only memories are of hindering shakes of fear and some pretty negative self-talk kicking in just after the fourth bolt. But I've had tons of practice calming down the shakes and I'm no stranger to replacing negative self-talk with more positive thoughts, so why are these skills not transfering to lead climbing?
 
The disconnect lies in breathing. Having played a number of different sports at fairly competative levels over the years, I've learned farily well that as soon as the body gets tired and starts gasping for air, the brain shuts down. On lead climbs, it's not so  much that I'm tried because I'm climbing several grades lower than I normally would. The issue is that I'm scared for my life, so I naturally spend the majority of the climb in the fight-or-flight state. This results extremely fast and shallow breaths, similating a state of physical fatigue, which inhibits my brain from doing things that it knows how to do.

The solution that I intend to implement sounds pretty simple: stop freaking out, notice that I'm uselessly hyperventilating, and force slow, calm, relaxed breaths. Putting this into practice, however, will be most of the battle (more on this later).

###Positive self-talk 
This is a simple tactic that I'm planning on adding to my thought process just after I've calmed myself down by drawing attention to my breathing. As I've written in a previous article, by drawing analogies to what we know we could do if we weren't afraid of falling, self-talk can be a very powerful tool in pretty much any aspect of life, including the task of confronting the fear of lead climbing. 

###Cozy up to fear
Although it seems like all of this building up to getting over my fear of lead climbing, I'm not deluding myself into thinking that it's actually possible to eradicate the sensation entirely. In fact, fear is extremely useful and, as some "adrenaline junkies" might argue, extremely fun. Our ability to follow our gut feeling while we're in the mountains is the very instinct that could keep us on the winning side of that fine line between safety and disaster.

So in fact, our goal here is not the eventual absence of fear. On the contrary, we seek a deeper, more intimate relationship with fear that allows us to listen to it, decide what to do about it, and be able to act on that decision without being hindered by fear itself. 

###Decide when fear is irrational 
Becoming more comfortable with fear is an extremely useful goal. One of the greatest benefits of attaining this level of comfort is being able to actually find out what is causing this fear. 

###Fall intentionally

###Communicate with my belayer

While these skills have proven extremely useful for numerous athletes across a multitude of sports (including climbing), they're all just too much for the mind to keep track of when our hear rate breaks 100 BPM and Elvis Leg kicks in two meters above the last bolt. The goal here is to practice mindfully and frequently so that these conscious checkpoints become more like subconscious habits. That way, instead of allowing fear to inhibit all constructive thinking at the very forefront of our minds, we can get back to the reasons that inspired us to head to the crag in the first place, whether that be mind-boggling beta,  that we would normally attempt on top rope or boulder problems without a second thought.
