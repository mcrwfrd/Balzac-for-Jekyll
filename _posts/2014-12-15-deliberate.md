[Justen Sjong](http://teamof2climbing.com/about/coaching/) is an accomplished climber and climbing coach who spent some time giving individual coaching sessions as well as group clinics at our [local bouldering gym](http://shaktirockgym.com/ "Shakti Rock Gym") in Montreal at the beginning of December. What follows is an attempt to help myself and others understand the climbing insight that Justen was trying to pass on during the Saturday group session that I had the privilege of attending.

Initially, I wasn’t really sure what to expect from our 3-hour session with Justen. Having grown up playing a variety of different sports at a competitive level, I’ve come into contact with many coaches who, much like Justen, had first-hand experience at the frontier of their sport both as athletes and as coaches. In my experience, many of the coaches fitting this description seemed to struggle with coaching athletes who were less developed than the professional athletes that they had grown accustomed to working with. Justen, however, was definitely an exception to this rule. Although he took a much more abstract approach to climbing than I could have predicted, it made me feel similar to the way I feel during most of my math lectures that I attend at university, not quite understanding every single word but playing catchup and eventually understanding the general concept that Justen was trying to get across. This style of coaching, which emphasizes the act of being a “student of your sport”, is one that I have always preferred and was happy to see again.  

Something else that Justen has in common with many of my favourite past coaches is that, as [one other climber](http://www.clairegaulinbrown.com/) at the clinic put it, he seems to preach the act of practicing excellence in any sport. To me, this says that if we really want to see gains in our climbing abilities, we need to focus on proper form and technique at all times. In other words, instead of going to the gym and sending three hard problems in a single session with sloppy form, we might have to get the climb dialed in two separate, immaculate pieces and work the rest of the week on putting all of the technique together into a single beautiful effort. 

But putting form and technique before sending is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what I learned from the three hours that we spent with Justen. There’s just so much to think about and digest that even when I try to boil down his teachings to as few core concepts as possible, it still ends up being way more than any climber can actually think about while climbing. However, I think a great way to summarize Justen’s teaching in a way that can actually be remembered when we’re about to step on the wall is to **climb deliberately**. 

What I mean by this is maybe more clear if I draw the analogy to our old friend Henry David Thoreau, who went out into the woods to “live deliberately”. Fed up with living life in a way that he could not justify to himself without acknowledging the pressures of society, Thoreau strove to pare down his life to as few elements as possible in an attempt to lead a life with more personal meaning. As climbers, we have to strive to mentally isolate ourselves (with our belayer) on the wall in order to focus on making our climbing as efficient as possible. My own interpretation of this boils down to three main pillars: finding our ideal focused mindset, directing that focus onto ourselves (the things we can control), and directing that focus outwards (the things we can’t control).

##Isolating the mind

To me, the first part of climbing deliberately starts before you step onto the wall. For many of us, climbing is as much a social activity as it is our daily dose of physical exercise. Especially at a small bouldering gym, the atmosphere can get pretty friendly and light-hearted, which makes it easy to just go through the motions, maybe giving 70% effort with each attempt. However, to climb deliberately is to prevent our focus and effort levels from being affected by the chummy vibe on the ground. Just like Thoereau had to physically isolate himself in the woods to discover what really mattered to him, we as climbers must mentally isolate ourselves when we’re on the wall so that we may focus on being the most attentive climbers that we can be. A great habit to get into is to develop a trigger, such as a deep belly breath or focusing our gaze on a single point for a few seconds in order to make this transition happen quickly every time we make an attempt at a problem. 

##Focusing inwards

Once we're in our own world on the route, we need to turn our attention inwards, meaning that we draw our attention to one of the three most important things that are in our control: our body position and movement, our breathing, and our thoughts or self-talk. 

Focusing on body movement and positioning may seem pretty obvious, since climbing is a purely athletic pursuit. But what I mean here is that we need to focus on very specific parts of the body. For example, while on a sloper, we might ask, “Is my body wiggling and squirming or are my muscles tight and keeping my body rigid?” When I’m on slopers, I find that I place too much attention on how my hands seem to be slipping off of the hold with each passing second, when instead I should focus on my legs and hips to stop them from wiggling around, which will then help me find stability on the hold. The little things we change in our body position to accomplish certain moves can be so subtle and unintuitive that they can sometimes go completely unseen.  

At other times, we need to focus inwards on our breathing and what **type** of breathing is required for a specific move or body position. For example, if we are balanced, we might take a moment to take a deep belly breath and get that much-needed oxygen to our barking muscles. At other times, we might be seeking stability and tensing all of the muscles in our core at once, which will require that we yell or exhale through clenched teeth. Justen also emphasizes that knowing what our yelling breath or our belly breath feels and sounds like can help us feel confident and focused when we’re on the wall.  

Finally, we need to directly observe our thoughts and our self-talk. I went topropping for the first time in about 8 months this past weekend and it took most of the short two-hour session for me to get completely over the fear of falling. With this prevailing thought in my mind, I naturally started to panic when I reached the 8th bolt of a route and the holds didn’t bite nearly as much as I had anticipated. My natural reaction was to basically stop thinking, squeeze the life out of the holds and pull myself up with my arms as quickly as possible, completely ignoring all of the technique that I had developed on the bouldering wall. If instead of allowing my initial reaction of fight or flight to take over, I became aware of my fear and replaced the “I can’t do it, I’m going to fall!” thoughts with something like “you’ve done this layback a million times on boulder problems, you can do it!”, then I might start to trust the friction of the holds and grip them in a much more efficient way, allowing my practiced technique to take over and get my body to the top. 

##Focusing outwards

Drawing our attention away from ourselves for moments during the climb can also be extremely helpful. This brand of focus deals with the things about the climb that we cannot control, such as where the holds are placed, what they feel like with different hands at different angles or where the next clip is located. Maybe this means brushing the holds on a boulder problem to find that thumb-catch which is going to make a world of difference. It might mean deciding that the foothold at a certain point is a huge jug while the hands are tiny crimps, in which case we have to decide to trust our feet more. At any rate, it requires that we are completely engrossed in the climb, meaning we’ve made a mental transition from the chummy world below, as well as from the previously-described mental state of channeling our focus inwards. 

***

In summary, these three points are what I would call **climbing deliberately** and form the bulk of what I have been able to glean from Justen’s clinic so far. I’m sure it comes nowhere near all of the information that he was trying to pass on. But even these three facets are a lot to think about - way too much to think about during a 45-second boulder problem. Just as it is possible to think too much in life, it is also possible to think too much while we’re climbing. The end goal here is that if we practice all of these techniques individually, it will become natural for us to do them all simultaneously without much mental effort. It might even become so natural that this kind of thinking takes place on a subconscious level and we achieve some state of flow in our climbing. With enough repetition, we will go from applying all of this theory in a highly robotic style to using it almost as second nature and climbing with palpable personality.
