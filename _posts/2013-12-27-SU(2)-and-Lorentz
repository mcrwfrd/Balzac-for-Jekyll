Consider the set, $$ SU(2, \mathbb{C}) $$, of $$ 2 x 2 $$ matrices of determinant one with complex entries. We claim that this set forms a group under standard matrix multiplication. The $$ 2 x 2 $$ identity matrix has determinant one and has entries in $$ \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C} $$, so clearly this clearly the identity element for this set. To show that each element $$ A \in SU(2, \mathbb{C}) $$ has an inverse element, it suffices to recall that \$$ \det A-1 = 1/\det A = 1 $$. To see that this set is closed under matrix multiplication, consider two matrices $$ A, B \in SU(2, \mathbb{C}) $$ and recall that \$$ \det A B = \det A \det B = 1 \cdot 1 = 1. Thus, we conclude that \$$ SU(2, \mathbb{C}) forms a group under matrix multiplication.
