-students spend a lot of time on input mode and not a lot of time on output mode - in fact, thats pretty much all we do
-sometimes we need the output mode in the context of school in order to succeed 
-we also need the output mode in life in general
-students of mathematics and physics are subject to sterotypes of their discipline and, as a result, tend to fulfill those stareotypes, almost without thinking. its almost like being nerdy and socially awkward makes you seem like you're better at what you do, but sticking feathers up your but does not make you a chicken, nor do you need feathers up your but in order to be a chicken
-so is this about input mode or output mode?
-guys, its time to get over yourselves
-

lets split this into two short(ish) articles 
     1. don't give in to stereotypes - self-fulfilling profecy stuff
     2. we are all creative

Don't give into stereotypes: 
-the stereotype is that mathematicians and physicsts are socially inept people, maybe this stems from the fact we spend all day in our little worlds - a valid point. I would argue that with just a little work (and this work that we should put in), we can become socially capable people
-in other words, i want to argue that being a mathematician doesn't need to define you
-in fact, your profession doesn't define you
-the problem with mathematics is that it also consumes you - its kinda hard to just do it for 8 hours a day and forget about it - people only do it because they really love it

Mathematicians and physicists tend to get a bad wrap in the real world. For whatever reason, they have received the blanket descriptions of "socially awkward", "bad dressers", "horrible at fashion", "unable to speak", or generally nerdy, and I would say that some mathematicians and physicists fully accept this description. In fact, in my experience, sometimes other members of this community judge your skill in your discipline based on how well you fit these descriptions. 

Q: Is that guy good at math?

A: Naw, way to fashionable. Probably spends too much time shopping to really get a grasp on the material.

I've heard those exact words come from the mouths of some of my peers in the physics department. And its not like they can help it - its kind of engrained in them from the very beginning. 

I would like to argue that this is pure nonsense. In order to be good at what you do, you do not, in any way, need to fit the description of the stereotype of your discipline. In other words, who you are, inside and out, does not need to define how good you are at your job. 

It's sort of an ancient debate. Is it "What you do defines who you are" or "Who you are define what you do"? This argument saw a lot of attention in the 1960s and 70s, and is a common debate between free-spirited youth and their hard-ass parents. 

If you truly follow your passion, then the way that you think will define what you end up doing, for sure. But thats only a fraction of who you are. On the other hand, if you allow what you do to define the way that you act and dress, then you're denying yourself a whole world where you can be creative and figure out who are independent of what you do when you go to work. 

That's not to say that you're not allowed to enjoy what you do. Indeed, the only way to be a full-time mathematician is to truly love it - there's not much more incentive to do it.
