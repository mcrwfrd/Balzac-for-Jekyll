-students spend a lot of time on input mode and not a lot of time on output mode - in fact, thats pretty much all we do
-sometimes we need the output mode in the context of school in order to succeed 
-we also need the output mode in life in general
-students of mathematics and physics are subject to sterotypes of their discipline and, as a result, tend to fulfill those stareotypes, almost without thinking. its almost like being nerdy and socially awkward makes you seem like you're better at what you do, but sticking feathers up your but does not make you a chicken, nor do you need feathers up your but in order to be a chicken
-so is this about input mode or output mode?
-guys, its time to get over yourselves
-

lets split this into two short(ish) articles 
     1. don't give in to stereotypes - self-fulfilling profecy stuff
     2. we are all creative

Don't give into stereotypes: 
-the stereotype is that mathematicians and physicsts are socially inept people, maybe this stems from the fact we spend all day in our little worlds - a valid point. I would argue that with just a little work (and this work that we should put in), we can become socially capable people
-in other words, i want to argue that being a mathematician doesn't need to define you
-in fact, your profession doesn't define you
-the problem with mathematics is that it also consumes you - its kinda hard to just do it for 8 hours a day and forget about it - people only do it because they really love it

Mathematicians and physicists tend to get a bad wrap from people who have never been in involved in the math or physics community. For whatever reason, they have received the blanket descriptions of "socially awkward", "bad dressers", "horrible at fashion", "unable to speak", or generally nerdy, and I would say that some mathematicians and physicists fully accept this description. In fact, in my experience, sometimes other members of this community judge your skill in your discipline based on how well you fit these descriptions. In fact, on numerous occations I have heard my peers in these communities directly assume that someone was not as capable because they were well-dressed and well-spoken.

Q: Is that guy good at math?

A: Naw, way to fashionable. Probably spends too much time shopping to really get a grasp on the material.


I've heard those exact words come from the mouths of some of my peers in the physics department. And its not like they can help it - its kind of engrained in them from the very beginning.

But it turns out that the way you dress and the way you speak has little impact on your ability to lay out on paper a mathematical proof. In fact, mathematics is such an individual thing that pretty much nothing outside of the way in whcih you think can tell a person how good you are at mathematics. The clothes on your body and your thoughts on mathematics are just completely unrelated. In fact, contrary to my peers' notions that fashion means inability in mathematics turns out to be completely wrong. As seen here, mathematics and fashion can work in perfact harmony. 

I would like to argue that this is pure nonsense. In order to be good at what you do, you do not, in any way, need to fit the description of the stereotype of your discipline. In other words, who you are, inside and out, does not need to define how good you are at your job. 

It's sort of an ancient debate. Is it "What you do defines who you are" or "Who you are define what you do"? This argument saw a lot of attention in the 1960s and 70s, and is a common debate between free-spirited youth and their hard-ass parents. 

If you truly follow your passion, then the way that you think will define what you end up doing, for sure. But thats only a fraction of who you are. On the other hand, if you allow what you do to define the way that you act and dress, then you're denying yourself a whole world where you can be creative and figure out who are independent of what you do when you go to work. 

That's not to say that you're not allowed to enjoy what you do. Indeed, the only way to be a full-time mathematician is to truly love it - there's not much more incentive to do it. 

Same thing with climbing. It's a little more subtle, but sometimes we judge a a dude's climbing ability based on how he looks when he walks into the gym. Does he have the goose-down patagonia jacket, those climbings-specific pants, that [sexy climbing hair](http://thestonemind.com/2014/01/07/six-steps-for-that-sexy-climber-hair/), etc. But none of it means anything about the dude's climbing abilitiy, really. I've lost track of the number of times that a really anuassuming person has walked into the gym who I would have judged to be a beginner climber based on the above gauges, and climbs a route harder than anything that I've ever even attempted. 

Its a nice reminder, really. I love the purity of the idea that it doesn't matter how you look or what you do when you're not climbing, you can still be an unreal climber if you dedicate enough time to it. I think this applies to most (if not all) other interests or discplines out there. You simply can't gauge someones ability at something without actually watching them do it.
