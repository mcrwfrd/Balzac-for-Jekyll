### The $$ 2 \times 2 $$ Special Linear Group

Consider the set of $$ 2 \times 2 $$ matrices of determinant one with complex entries, denoted $$ SL(2, \mathbb{C}) $$. We claim that this set forms a group under standard matrix multiplication. The $$ 2 \times 2 $$ identity matrix has determinant one and has entries in $$ \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C} $$, so this is clearly the required identity element for this set. To show that each element $$ A \in SL(2, \mathbb{C}) $$ has an inverse element, it suffices to recall that 
$$ 
\det A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} = 1
$$
To see that this set is closed under matrix multiplication, consider two matrices $$ A, B \in SL(2, \mathbb{C}) $$ and recall that 
$$ 
\det A B = \det A \det B = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 
$$
Thus, we conclude that $$ SL(2, \mathbb{C})$$ forms a group under matrix multiplication.
