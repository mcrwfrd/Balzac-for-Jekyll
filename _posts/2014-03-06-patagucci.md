-the reason they get called "patagucci" is because rich people buy their clothing just for the brand name so they can look stylish in their range rover on the way to the ski hill -> if people are buying your stuff for brand name recognition, that doesn't mean that your business model is fundamentally flawed, it means that you did a good job with branding and marketing. the patagucci stuff out there isn't trying to hurt the company, its mocking the people who go in just for the brand name recognition

-patagonia seems to have a lot of global efforts, are there any small-scale efforts, helping people on the low end of the economy? Maybe the biggest criticism of Patagonia is that they're not helping low-income Americans, but hey, they're not running for president of the united states - they have a focus as  a company which is mostly environmental -  I would argue that they don't need to "do it all"

-I for one have never purchased a single item of Patagonia clothing, 

-so why has patagonia come under such scrutiny? why can't they just be a company who sells top quality clothing at a matching price? people want their clothing, whether they're interested in sustainability or not, so why do they need activism on this front? isn't the desire of the consumers just a result of good branding and good marketing? 

well, Patagonia has simply done a good job of identifying who is buying their stuff and trying to tap into what they need. 

consider the typical customer at, say, Forever 21. They're not looking for top quality clothing, and they're not expecting top notch clothing and they're not expecting a sustainability effort because thats not what Forever 21 represents. Forever 21 is about really cheap stuff for people who are interested in looking good, and there's a market for that stuff. Most students are more comfortable only caughing up $40.00 at at the cash register for a couple of new additions because the're interested in looking good in a way that they can afford. Not everyone can front the $400.00 for a jacket that's going to last them the next ten years like they might at Patagonia. I would argue that over the ten year time span, you're getting more out of the Patagonia jacket by investing in it initially, but not everyone has that luxury. 

So the same guy who has the mind to front the $400.00 for a jacket that will last him ten years probably has the same mindset about the economy and the environment - investing for the future. So all Patagonia has really done is match what they think their ideal customer is thinking. They really have the same "investing for the future" mindset as their consumers do. 

I happen to agree with this buying philosphy. "Only buy stuff if you really need it, and when you do buy something, shell out for quality, long-lasting, and resonsible stuff." This leads to a pretty minimalist life since I pretty much *never* have the money to shell out for the quality, so I just don't buy. 

WHY PATAGONIA'S PHIL. WILL WORK
-because they're ahead of the curve in recognizing that this is the buying mindset of the future, even though change is slow because our current economy does not support this kind of thinking
-in a sense, they're pioneers  - is anyone else catering to this mindset?
-this philosphy is going to work because they have the expertise to make gear that people can actually use in the outdoors, so they will be able to compete with brands who are making specific things, and its going to be competatively priced, but the people who buy their stuff are also spending a lot of their fun time in the enrivonment, so they're concerned about it, so they're going to choose the brand with the environemntally friendly label whenever the price is competetive and the gear meets their needs. 

for example, [here's](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Down-Jacket-Reviews) outdoor gear lab's review of the top 15 down jackets on the market. Notice that patagonia has two jackets on the list, one of which narrowly missed getting the editors choice award, and both of which are competetively priced. Q: is patagonia the only one of these companies who has an environemntal initiative? they at least have the strongest one...

Here's a good idea. What if outdoor companies could join forces, set aside money that contributes to sustainability in this way, and form a governing board that decides what each campaign will be? Becuase environmentalism shouldnt be a factor that can contribute to your branding, eventually it should just be a standard way in which companies across the board should operate. Does this exist somewhere?

I think by biggest criticism for the company is that they're sort of selling a lifestyle but they don't actually sell any gear - mostly clothing. Sure, its durable, but they're kind of selling a "poser" attitude. The fact of the matter is, you don't need anything that Patagonia sells in order to climb, ski, surf, fish, or trail run. In fact, almost nothing that they sell is gear that you actually need to do any of those things. You could get ourself entire outfits for those sports without even glancing at Patagonia. As an adventurer, they sell nothing that you need, and you don't actually need anything that they sell. And yet somehow they've targeted outdoorsy people. You definitely don't need to go climbing every weekend in order to be entitled to shop at patagonia, but if you do, then other people might think that you climb every weekend. Black diamond makes my tent, solomon my ski gear, petzl my rock hardware...

From my perspective, its not about the gear. I'd like to tell myself that I don't care how I look when I'm doing things, but in the end, I actually do....

A good rain coat does two things really well:
1. Keeps you dry
2. Lasts a long time

A good goose-down jacket does two things really well:
1. Keeps you really warm with light-weight material
2. Lasts a long time. 

This is what Patagonia's gear is all about. It's functional, it lasts a long time. That's also why its expensive. It's functional, and it last a long time, so hopefully you won't have to buy another one for the next 10 years - and their prices are also competitive. But it also looks pretty good, which is why a lot of people who equate a sunday hike with getting in touch with nature at the core. Yeah, a Sunday hike rejuvenates me if I'm stuck working in the city, but it's nothing compared to a canoe trip in Algonquin's interior. Why does it have to look good? If everyone had the mentality of Yvon, nobody would care how it looks. But the fact of the matter is, no matter how much we tell ourselves that it's just not about the gear, we care (at least just a little bit) about how we look when we're on our favourite adventures. A tiny part of all of us hopes that we look half as good as that funhogger in our favourite adventure movie. That's some powerful marketing. 

I went skiing this past weekend for the first time in the season - late, I know, kind of embarassing. But I noticed something interesting that was more apparent skiing than it seemed to be at the climbing crag - everyone was super worried about their steeze. 





So what the heck is my point? My point is: from the mouth of a peniless student and a wannabe ski bum, here's why its important to support one of the most expensive outdoor outfitters. 

***

Patagonia, the popular outdoor outfitting brand worn by climbing bums, rich college students and drivers of range rovers, has earned more attention than usual recently after urging their customers to refrain from buying things on black friday and naming Rose Marcario their President and CEO. In recent years Patagonia has backed the idea that the environment and social responsibility should take precedence over financial gain. With several projects on the go (Chouinard even spend over 1.3 M on their Patagonia Provisions project), this company is doing all of the right things in my mind (and they're still financially successful), so naturally, I became extremely skeptical. 

In spite of their good efforts, the company has earned a bit of flack along with their praise. Specifically, I have heard two complains about the brand from a couple of different parties (I'm not sure if they're the same party of two different ones). 

I know Patagonia is kind of abusing the image of being outdoorsy. They claim that the clothing they make is for the outdoorsy type, meanwhile the majority of their customers are yuppies seeking that perfect powder blue michelin man down jacket to get that "outdoorsy look" when their away from the office or college kids blowing their parents trust fund so that it at least looks like they're doing more than doddling around at Liberal Arts college trying to postpone real life. But the fact that people are willing to shell out $400.00 on a jacket with tech specs that they don't really need for floating around campus just tells me that Patagonia has done an excellent job with branding and marketing. 

I suspect that these complaints are coming from idealist adventuring dirtbags who think being "hardcore" is about living out of a van and never buying good gear. They're offended that a piece of gear that they might actually need at the crag also attracts the above-mentioned crowds. They're thinking, "I'm just looking to simplify" and I just want a bloody rain coat, not something made out recycled plastic etc. 

But here's why we need to care about what Patagonia is doing, whether we go home to a tent in Yosemite, a college dorm room, or a walk-up in NYC or San Fran, especially you, dirtbags. 

Whether you're a skier 6 days a week, a weekend warrior, or only get to ski ones every few seasons, you should care about what Patagonia because they're one of the largest companies in the outdoor industry (of course, they're not the only one) who are really breaking ground in a new way. They're working extremely hard to preserve the nature that brought us to either love or hate their clothing in the first place. 

Consider yourself in the position to buy a rain coat. Everyone needs a bloody rain coat. No matter how often you actually get to the crag, you need a rain coat. When you're looking for a rain coat, you're looking for a couple of different things, but above, you want it to keep the rain out, and you want it to last a long time. Of course, there are other factors to consider such as breathability, weight, packability, helmet compatibility and general comfort. But these all come out in the wash. If you're looking for a dependable coat that keeps the rain out and will last a long time, well, pretty much every outdoor outfitter from Marmot to North Face to Mountain Equipment co-op is making such a product, and Patagonia is right here with everyone else at a comparable price. So they're making a product that can be used by avid adventurers as well as literally anyone who might get caught in the rain, including that college freshman with a focus on long-lasting materials. On top of that, they're a socially responsible company who, as stated above, put a couple of things above making money on their priority list, which is a good number in my books. So even if their rain jacket is meets the same spec requirements as does the Marmot jacket or the North Face jacket and is $50 more, I'm going to pick the Patagonia jacket every time because they're helping everyone take responsibility for preserving the environment that brings us so much joy either thrice a season, every weekend, or 6 days a week. It's not about the fact that this one jacket was made from recycled plastic - its about choosing a company that is on the right tracks socially, environmentally and economically. 

We need to support this company because their list of priorities as an organization sets the bar high for any other company looking to make money. The mission statement of patagonia should be the same for every other company out there. Its just the way it should be. 

But still, I can't help but shake the fact that Yvon probably wouldn't be wearing patagonia gear if he were a 20-something trying to spend as much time climbing as possible. But my point is that a raincoat is going to be expensive no matter what, so you might as well opt for the company which helps us preserve the environment that we so adore.

I think some of us just hate the thought that we dirtbags, the freest of them all, should have interest in a garment that Mr. or Mrs. Yuppie could find a use for. But we really should care.
