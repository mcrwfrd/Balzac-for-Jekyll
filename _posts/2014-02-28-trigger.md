Being a resident of Montreal, a freezing Canadian city, walking around the city facing the harsh weather tends to wear down my patience so slowly that I almost don't notice it. Instead of strolling along the side walk at a steady pace in the sunshine, it’s usually more of an awkward walk/run thing, hands stuffed in my pockets, shoulders shrugged up to my ears in an effort to battle the face-blistering winds - I'm sure it looks absolutely ridiculous. 

Having lived through many such Canadian winters, I have built up a sort of mental toughness that helps me deal with this kind of weather. However, the other day on my way to school, I found myself on the edge of my patience threshold. My focus slipped, my blood started to boil, and just as I was about to give in to frustration, I caught a glimpse of a madman riding his bike in the howling arctic winds, and he was _singing_. 


Now, I've commuted by bicycle through a couple of Montreal winters, so I know from experience that it is a daily mental battle. Usually a lot of warm clothing is required to make it bearable, but the majority of commuting cyclists are probably not decked out in full Arc'teryx ski kit for their daily commute. In fact, the *reason* that they’re commuting by bicycle is because they can’t afford such things. Needless to say, bicycle commuters are definitely freezing their buns off throughout the winter.


So watching this cyclist nonchalantly pass by - riding through rush hour traffic, dodging potholes and ice patches, battling ferocious winds and frigid temperatures all the while - reminded me that it wasn't actually that cold. Sure, our winters are brutal. But I was warmly dressed and was definitely not battling the winds that the cyclist was facing. In fact, at that moment, I tricked myself into thinking is was almost *balmy*. I let my shoulders relax, put on some music, and actually enjoyed the rest of the walk to school in the fresh winter air. The dark mood that winter tried to cast upon my day had been lifted. 

And remember that this just came about as the result of one little trigger - a singing cyclist. He was in my view for a maximum of five seconds, and I soon forgot about him. But that little trigger was all I needed to take myself from the edge of my patience to a happier state of mind. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one with triggers like this. In fact, I'm sure we all have different ones, drawing on our previous life experiences to create them. For me, a cyclist singing in this weather made an especially large impact because I've *been* that cyclist, and I know how cold the experience can be. So if he was able to relax, then I could definitely do the same.

With enough practice, we can have these triggers start to come from within. Instead of relying on the chance that something externally might trigger a shift in our moods, wouldn't it be nice to be able to recognize thoughts that keep us calm and come back to them in times of stress? I’m sure our dramatically carefree cyclist was making use of this technique with his own mental triggers, consciously or not, but he shouldn’t be the only one. It can be used by all of us in our daily lives - it’s just a matter of finding our mental trigger.
