                Here is some temporary text: Up until this point, it has been most natural to think of the obejects representing these equivlance classes as lines. However, later, it will be better to pick representatives from these lines and, instead of talking about the rays in the projective space, we will talk about the points in the projective space. In this sense, we think of all objects in the projective space as having one dimension less than their corresponding object in the vector space that we are projecting from.
