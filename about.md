## About me
I am currently completing a joint Mathematics and Physics degree at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. My interest is usually piqued most by topics in the area of mathematical physics, including complex analysis, topology, group theory, quantum mechanics, and quantum information theory. But for now, I am trying to keep things as general as possible before specializing in graduate school.

When I'm not working on one of the above subjects, I tend to dabble in areas such as computer programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. While away from my desk, I can be found jogging, rock climbing, or socializing at one of Montreal's many beautiful cafes. 

To get in touch with me, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelcrwfrd) or [send me an email](mailto:michael.crawford@mail.mcgill.ca). You can also view all of the [code](https://github.com/mcrwfrd/mcrwfrd.github.io) for this website on GitHub.

## Publications
I am currently working on my first official academic publication which features the application of group theory and projective geometry in the world of quantum mechanical symmetries.
