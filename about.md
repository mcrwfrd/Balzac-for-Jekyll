I am currently completing a joint Mathematics and Physics degree at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. My interested is especially piqued by areas mathematical physics such as group theory, quantum mechanics, topology and complex analysis.

I like to teach myself things outside of school by reading and doing. Lately I've been learning about computer programming and creative writing. 

While away from my desk, I can be found skiing, trail running, rock climbing, or socializing at one of Montreal's many beautiful cafes.
