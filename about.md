## About me
I am currently completing a joint Mathematics and Physics degree at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. My interest is usually piqued most by topics in the area of mathematical physics, including group theory, quantum mechanics, topology, and complex analysis. But for now, I am trying to keep things as general as possible before specializing in graduate school.

When I'm not working on one of the above subjects, I tend to dabble in areas such as computer programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. While away from my desk, I can be found jogging, rock climbing, or socializing at one of Montreal's many beautiful cafes.
