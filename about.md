I have an insatiable yearning to immerse myself in the beautiful, unforgiving wilderness of our planet in order to push my body to its limit. If I’m not skiing, trail running, rock climbing or canoe tripping, then I’m somewhere else planning and dreaming about the next outdoor adventure. 

While completing the last few semesters of my bachelor’s degree in mathematics, I’m doing my best to immerse myself in the outdoor community here on the East Coast. Upon graduation, I’ll move to the mountains in order to combine my skills in mathematics with my passion for all outdoor pursuits.  

If you’re interested in collaborating, finding out more, or just catching up, feel free to contact me via any of the social media platforms below!
