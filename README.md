This was the Jekyll theme which powered [my webpage](http://crawford.io) some time around 2014. 

I forked [Cole Townsend](http://coletownsend.com)'s [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) theme, and was heavily inspired by [Jaan Altosaar's webpage](https://jaan.io) during this project.
